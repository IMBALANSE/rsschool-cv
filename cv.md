#### About Me
My goal is to learn how to easily convert tasks into high-quality code. I started my career as an area sales manager in 2011 to 2016 

From 2016 until 2022 I worked for an electronic equipment repair company. Now I want to change the direction of development from hard to software. Since I like developing interfaces more.
